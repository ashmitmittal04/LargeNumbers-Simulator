A Java GUI application simulating the Law of Large Numbers through a dice rolling experiment. A dice will be rolled as many times as requested, and the probability of each possible outcome will be tracked along the way.


The Law of Large Numbers is a statistical principle that states that as the size of a sample increases, the average or mean of the sample will tend to get closer to the average or mean of the whole population from which the sample is drawn. In simpler terms, larger samples provide more reliable and accurate estimates of population characteristics.
